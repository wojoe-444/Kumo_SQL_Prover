"""A counterexample is a database the tables can hold: every value fits the declared type of its column.

``_Prover._nice_model`` asks the solver for a readable model once a difference is found. Its preference "every value
is a number" ignored declared column types, and the value sort has none of its own, so a counterexample could hold
the number 1 in a STRING column or the string ``'A'`` in an INT64 key. The pair really differs in those cases, but the
database shown cannot be loaded into the tables it describes. Found on 2026-11-10 while comparing 600 generated
pairs before and after another fix to the same function (``tests/test_counterexample_time_limit.py``).
