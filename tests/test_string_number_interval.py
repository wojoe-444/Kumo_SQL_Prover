"""``x + INTERVAL ..`` is a date, a timestamp or an interval, not a number (``kumo_sql_prover.string_number_compare``).

``d BETWEEN '2000-10-01' AND CAST('2000-10-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY`` compares a date column with a date string
and a date. The guard against a string compared with a number read the ``+`` as arithmetic on numbers and declined every
query with such a bound, even against itself. Arithmetic on numbers is still declined.
