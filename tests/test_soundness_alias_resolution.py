"""A bare name in ORDER BY or QUALIFY that is both a select alias and a source column.

BigQuery reads the alias in ORDER BY (inside expressions and windows too) and everywhere in QUALIFY; it reads the
source column in WHERE and in the select list. DuckDB reads the source column everywhere except a bare ORDER BY key.
The provers used to read the source column inside an ORDER BY expression and inside a QUALIFY window on every
dialect, which proved pairs BigQuery answers differently. Every BigQuery expectation below was run there on
2026-11-10 with inline values (zero bytes billed); the DuckDB ones run in ``test_duckdb_reads_the_source_column``.
