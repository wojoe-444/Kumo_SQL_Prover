"""A counterexample orders its strings as strings are ordered.

The provers order strings by an uninterpreted rank (``smt_equivalence._string_rank``) and state only the order of the
queries' own string literals. That is enough for a proof, but a model of a difference may rank every other string as
it likes, and the counterexample search evaluated both queries through that model. So ``WHERE s < ''`` against
``WHERE 1 = 0`` was reported NOT_EQUIVALENT with ``s = 'A'`` (no string is below the empty one: the pair is equal on
every STRING column), and ``WHERE s < 'b' AND s > 'a'`` was "shown" to return a row for ``s = ''``. Found 2026-11-10.

Every counterexample below is loaded into DuckDB tables of the declared types and both queries are run on it.
