"""A derived table kept whole is compared with the prover itself, in the dialect of the proof it belongs to.

``smt_equivalence._unify_opaque`` proves two differently written derived tables equal so they can share one identity.
It used to read both bodies as BigQuery whatever dialect the caller asked for. Two things went wrong under MySQL,
PostgreSQL and DuckDB:

* a proof was lost: ``1.00`` is an exact decimal there and a FLOAT64 in BigQuery, so ``p * (1 - d)`` and
  ``p * (1.00 - d)`` stopped matching once NUMERIC arithmetic was modelled for BigQuery (SQLSolver's TPC-H pair 20);
* a pair was proved that is not equivalent: ``0.1`` and ``0.10000000000000000001`` are one FLOAT64 in BigQuery and
  two different decimals elsewhere.
