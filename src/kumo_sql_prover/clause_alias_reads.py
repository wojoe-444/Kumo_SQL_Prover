"""What an unqualified name means in QUALIFY and in a window of ORDER BY when a select alias has that name.

``SELECT b AS a FROM t QUALIFY RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a) = 1`` has two candidates for ``a``: the output ``b AS a`` and
the column ``t.a``. The engines disagree. Checked on BigQuery (2026-11-10, inline values, zero bytes billed) and on
DuckDB 1.5.6:

* BigQuery reads the **alias** everywhere in QUALIFY (a bare name, a window's argument, its ``PARTITION BY`` and its
  ``ORDER BY``) and in a window inside ORDER BY; it reads the **column** in WHERE and in the select list, windows
  there included;
* DuckDB reads the **column** in all of those places whenever the source has one of that name.

The algebraic prover computes a select's windows in a derived table over its FROM (``_isolate_windows``), where a bare
name can only be a source column. It used to move a QUALIFY window there unchanged, so the BigQuery query above was
read as ranking by ``t.a`` and proven equal to the one that says ``ORDER BY t.a``; BigQuery returns different rows.

:func:`resolve_alias_reads` runs before any window is compared or moved and leaves no such name behind:

* where the alias is the only reading (BigQuery, or the source has no column of that name) the name is replaced by
  the alias's expression, so every bare name left in QUALIFY is a source column or an alias that *is* that column;
* where the engine would read the column, or the columns of the source are not known, the query is refused
  (:class:`~kumo_sql_prover.ast_utils.UnmodeledConstruct`): unknown beats wrong.

An ORDER BY key outside a window is not touched here: ``smt_equivalence._split_limit`` reads a bare key as the output
of that name (both engines do) and refuses an expression that reads a shadowing alias.
