"""On MySQL, ``CAST(EXISTS(...) AS SIGNED)`` in the query's output is the ``EXISTS`` itself.

MySQL has no boolean type: ``EXISTS (subquery)`` evaluates to the integer 1 or 0 and is never
NULL, and ``CAST(.. AS SIGNED)`` of an integer is that integer. Calcite prints ``CAST(<condition>
AS BOOLEAN)`` around a rewritten quantified comparison, which read as MySQL is ``CAST(<condition>
AS SIGNED)``; once the quantified read-back (``kumo_sql_prover.nonnull_any``) has turned the condition into
an ``EXISTS``, the cast is all that separates it from the query it was rewritten from.

This is a fact about MySQL only: in BigQuery ``CAST(TRUE AS INT64)`` is the number 1 and not the
boolean TRUE, so every other dialect is left alone. It is applied only to a whole item of the
outermost select's list, where the value is the query's output and nothing else reads it. A cast
inside arithmetic, a comparison, GROUP BY or a derived table keeps its spelling, and so does a
cast of any other operand: a comparison, ``IS``, ``IN``, ``NOT EXISTS``, a column. Those are 1, 0
or NULL on MySQL as well, but ``tests/test_mysql_boolean_outputs.py`` records the decision not to
identify ``x = 1`` with ``CAST(x = 1 AS SIGNED)`` by default, and this module does not revisit it.
