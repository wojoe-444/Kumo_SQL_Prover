"""``COUNT`` tests in ``HAVING``: an implied lower bound is dropped, and a counted key is not NULL.

Every aggregate of one ``HAVING`` clause reads the same group, and for any group
``COUNT(*) >= COUNT(x) >= COUNT(DISTINCT x)`` (the rows, the rows where ``x`` is not NULL, the different
values among those). A ``COUNT`` is never NULL, so a comparison of one with a literal is TRUE or FALSE.

**Implied bound.** In a conjunction, ``COUNT(*) >= n`` says nothing new next to a conjunct that puts a lower
bound of at least ``n`` on any ``COUNT`` (``COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) > 1`` gives ``COUNT(*) >= 2``), and
``COUNT(x) >= n`` nothing next to such a bound on ``COUNT(DISTINCT x)`` of the same ``x``. The bounding
conjunct is TRUE only when the implied one is, so the conjunction keeps the same groups without it.
A lower bound is read from ``>= m`` (``m``), ``> m`` (``m + 1``) and ``= m`` (``m``), with the literal on
either side; only ``>=`` and ``>`` tests are ever dropped.

**Counted key.** Under a plain ``GROUP BY`` every row of a group has the group's key ``k`` (as the grouping
compares it), so in the group whose ``k`` is NULL ``COUNT(k)`` and ``COUNT(DISTINCT k)`` are 0. A conjunct
that bounds either from below by 1 or more therefore fails for that group, and ``k IS NOT NULL`` may be added
to the conjunction: it removes no group the bound keeps. Written out, the test moves to ``WHERE``
(``having_rules``), where ``GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(email) > 1`` meets
``WHERE email IS NOT NULL GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(*) > 1``. Needs a ``GROUP BY`` of plain keys (no
``ROLLUP``, ``CUBE`` or grouping sets, which NULL a key in their super-groups), a key that is a column, and
no select alias that takes the key's name.

Counts with ``FILTER``, ``OVER`` or other modifiers are not read: they do not count the group's rows.
